# AoC in Laravel

This uses a simplified installation of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). The test runner is an Artisan command and can be executed with:

```bash
php artisan aoc
```

The command accepts an optional `input` argument, as well as accepts input from `STDIN`. If no input is provided then it uses the [input files](../inputs/).

A specific day or part can be specified with the `-d` and `-p` switches.
